# Digital-Clock-Using-Java-Swing
It is a single handed minor project, In this project, we have built a digital clock hour, min &amp;  seconds count time. The clock runs from 00:00:00 to 11:59:00 and then back to 00:00:00. Our  display has six digits, two digits for minutes and two for hour and two for seconds.
